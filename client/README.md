based on `angular-seed` â€” the seed for AngularJS apps
## TODO
 - implement pure angular dragndrop to remove angular.ui.sortable because it depends on JQuery.
 - perf: put in cache available tracks instead of retrieving them on each action...
 - show errors (ngMessages ?)
 - need refactor : a service should describe invariant data (tracks, directories)
